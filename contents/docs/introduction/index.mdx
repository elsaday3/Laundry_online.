Welcome to **Documents**, a powerful and flexible Next.js documentation starter kit designed to simplify the process of creating high-quality, comprehensive
product documentation, technical manuals, and business guides. Built with **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**, this starter kit provides the
foundation to build your project documentation and knowledge base.

Documents was crafted to streamline the creation, management and showcasing of documentation, allowing developers and teams to focus on the content rather
than building the underlying structure. This documentation aims to help you get up and running with the kit, exploring the various features and providing
insights into how to structure and present your content effectively.
